# What I learned about Git/GitHub

I learned several things about Git/GitHub that I didn't know, although I had previously worked with Git doing the following:
- I used repositories in GitHub
- I used repositories on GitLab
- I cloned repositories
- I did commits
- I used branches
- I merged branches

But thanks to this text I was able to learn and reinforce knowledge about:
- Forks
- Pull requests
- Issues
- Documentation of markdon files

In the future I would like to continue practicing the knowledge I learned thanks to this document.

So far what I have liked most about the course is learning about GitHub because it is something that I can apply in any subject and in my life as a programmer.
